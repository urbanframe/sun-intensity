# Sun Intensity 

Home Assistant integration to display the intensity of the sun on your house walls, based on the suns direction (Azimuth).

# Installation

Sun Intensity can be installed via HACS or by copying the sun-intensity folder to the [custom_components](https://github.com/urbanframe/sun-intensity/tree/main/custom_components/sun_intensity) folder within Home Assistant.

# Configuration

Configuration requires the longitude, latitude and rotation of your property. This information can be obtained from [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com).

Change the latitude and longitude format to decimal, using the settings.

The longitude and latitude can be seen in the bottom right hand corner.

* Latitude ending with N = Positive number
* Latitude ending with S = Negative number
* Longitude ending with E = Positive number
* Longitude ending with W = Negative number

Eg, 51.501079째N 0.142612째W would be:
* Longitude: 51.501079
* Latitude: -0.142612



Using the measure tool draw a line parallel with the sides of your property from the rear to the front. The rotation will be displayed as the heading in the measure toolbox.
